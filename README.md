An overview of the analysis:
We used a dataset of historical lending activity to create a model that will predict whether or not a borrower is a credit risk. 

The results: 
Overall, the accuary score was .99.

For class 0, the precision score was 1.
For class 1, the precision socre was .85.

For class 0, the recall score was .99.
For class 1, the recall score was .90

Summary:
The model was very accurate in its findings. We should use this model to predict, as it had a very high accuary score and was able to predict the correct class most of the time.
